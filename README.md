# Python_Project
A repository for QA Python Project

The concept behind this project is a fortune telling programme. The user wil be presented with the choice to exit the programme frequently by typing 'exit;, and the programme will not close without this 'exit' input from the user.

If the user wishes to play the fortune telling game, they will be presented with a hypothetical choice: There are four roads ahead of them: one red, one green, one blue, and one 'exit'. The user will be prompted to choose one of these four options via input. If the user chooses 'exit', the programme will end. If they choose red, green, or blue, the programme will tell one of two fortunes based on a random generator code. If the user inputs something else, like 'purple', the programme will scold them and restart. 

The user will be presented with the option to play the game again once their fortune has been told. Once again if the user chooses to exit here, the programme will end. Otherwise, the game will play again/ask again.
